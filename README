About 
=====

The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database is the culmination of several 
decades of independent and collaborative research by scholars drawing
upon data in libraries and archives around the Atlantic world. The
Voyages website itself is the product of two years of development by a
multi-disciplinary team of historians, librarians, curriculum specialists,
cartographers, computer programmers, and web designers, in consultation
with scholars of the slave trade from universities in Europe, Africa,
South America, and North America. The National Endowment for the
Humanities is the principal sponsor of the project, and it is an Emory
University Digital Library Research Initiative.

Deployment Notes
================

Because the data comes in various forms that change over time there isn't a straight path to many of the 
deployments or upgrades.  These are notes related to how we have been able to work through that process
in the past.

Basic deploy
------------

1. Copy current war file to /opt/tomcat/oldwars
2. Redirect site to static page or put tomcat in maintenance mode
3. Backup code and database as necessary
4. Shutdown tomcat
5. Run any SQL scripts if necessary
6. Clear the cache by deleting everything in /opt/tomcat/work directory
7. Delete webapps/tast.war and webapps/tast
8. Move new war file into webapps directory
9. Restart tomcat

First Time Deployment Instructions
----------------------------------

1. Backup up the database and create new database using the backup (Frank)
2. Backup code base using this command while in the webapps directory: tar -czvf tast-voyages.tar.gz tast voyages tast.war voyages.war
3. Move tast-voyages.tar.gz to /opt/tomcat/oldwars/tast-voyages.tar.gz_[date].
4. copy the existing war files from the webapps directory to /opt/tomcat/oldwars/war_[date].
5. Delete the following files from the tomcat directory (above webapps):

* demo.mov
* hibernate.properties
* gcgraph.war
* footer.jsp
* jspbook.jar
* tast.properties
* team.jsp
* tast.war

7. Run the SQL Scripts listedbelow on tast_v1 database. These are located in the etc/database directory in the SVN repo

* voyages.alter.sql - adds new columns to voyages table
* voyages.alter_script_release_2_4_2.sql - modifies some column lengths for the 2.4.2 release.
* publish.sql
* Updates the publish function
* publish.alter.sql - updates constraints so that the publish function executes efficiently.
* publishpreUpdate.sql - function called before date-update is executed
* publishPostUpdate.sql - function called after date-update is executed
* date-update.sql - updates date format in voyages table (may have to run each line in procs manualy)
* region-port-codes.sql - inserts missing region and port codes into tables
* ton_type-create.sql - creates ton_type table and inserts values to this table

11. Upload estimates-method.pdf,

14. shutdown tomcat
15. Delete tomcat/webapps/voyages directory
16. Delete the cache in tomcat/work directory
17. Restart tomcat
18. Review changes on /voyages
19. Dr. Eltis logs to /voyages as Admin and deletes or enables usrs.
20. Shutdown tomcat
21. Delete tast.war and tast and voyages.war and voyages directory
22. Build new war file with correct settng for tast and deploy to webapps directory

1. Backup databae
2. Run  the refresh-1.sql script located here in the repository ...etc/database/import/refresh-1.sql
3. Modify CSV file

* Insert new columns named iid, revision, and suggestion
* Generate a sequence number for each iid
* Set suggestion to 'f'

* PSPad seems to do a good job with this
* Open file in PSPad and select format > UTF8
* Save and Exit

5. Run publishpreupdate function
6. upload the file - must be superuser

* open input file as a text file and copy the header row
  past list of fields into the command:
* COPY voyages
  (<list of fields>)
  from E'\\pathto\\file' WITH NULL AS ' ' DELIMITER ','  CSV HEADER;

* Change config in each program to point to the correct env.
* Run thru eclipse
