documented directly, but is inferred by historians from data variables. The 
essay, “Construction of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database: Methods and 
Sources,” located in “Understanding the Database,” a subsection of “The 
Database,” explains the assumptions and basis of all imputed variables. On the

information inferred by historians from information that is found directly in 
sources. Data variables (variables in the database without asterisks) are 
documented directly from  primary sources that provide evidence of a slaving 
voyage. For example, historical documents rarely indicate that a port where 
slaves disembarked was the principal place of landing, but when documentation 
exists on the number of slaves disembarked at several ports, the historian can 
determine where the largest number were disembarked, the principal place of 
disembarkation for the voyage. In some cases, how many slaves embarked is 
documented, but not how many disembarked. From the survival rate on voyages with 
the same characteristics, we impute the number who did so on the voyage with 
missing information. The essay, “Construction …: Methods and Sources,” explains

to enter a specific number or range of numbers. If it is a name, like that of a 
ship or its captain or the owner of the venture, one is asked to enter the name

INSERT INTO faqs (id, cat_id, question, answer) VALUES (21, 3, 'How do I control 
for certain variables in analyzing data in other variables in the main database 
and estimates?', '<p>A control variable is one that does not change (or is held 
constant) during analysis of data in order to minimize its effect on results. 
The reason for doing this is to see more clearly the effects of other variables. 
Consider the following example. In the Voyages Database, a researcher wishes to 
examine differences in mortality on slave voyages organized in Great Britain and 
mainland North American colonies. She begins by setting three criteria in the 
query frame: a) time frame: 1700-1749; b) place where voyage began: Great 
Britain (clicking on Great Britain, England, Scotland, and Ireland); and c) 
outcome of voyage for owners: Delivered slaves for original owners. Time frame 
is selected because the researcher wants to see if any difference between 
British and American voyages persisted over time. She plans to obtain results 
first for the period 1700-49, and then for 1750-99. The second variable, where 
the voyage began, is the one whose effect on mortality the researcher is 
interested in. The third variable, outcome for owner, is the control variable. 
It will not change throughout the analysis. It affects the results, but the 
researcher is more interested in the effect of the place where the voyage was 
organized. By limiting the analysis only to voyages completed as the owner of 
the venture intended, the researcher is able to eliminate the effect on results 
of other possible outcomes, such as shipwreck or capture at see by an enemy 
ship.</p>');

probably information in your cache from previous sessions which prevents you

default settings and to the first page (Results) of Search the Database. If it 
does not do this, another more roundabout way to get to default settings is to 
close the browser window (not just a tab since the browser may retain the

specified in the query frame, the summary statistics describe the entirety of 
the slave trade. While in summary statistics, however, you can select voyages in 
the query frame at the left to see how they compare with the general average in 
the entire data set. For example, to answer the question, did the average number 
of slaves embarked on slave voyages decline or increase in the era of abolition 
after 1808, simply change the time frame on the left to 1808 to 1866 and click 
on “Search.”  </p>');

INSERT INTO faqs (id, cat_id, question, answer) VALUES (28, 5, 'What do 
“averages” calculated in Summary Statistics, Tables, and the Timeline mean?', 
'<p>An average is a value that is typical or representative of all values for 
the group of persons or things it describes. It is important to remember that 
the meaning of an average should be judged by the amount of deviation of 
particular cases around it. For four voyages landing 250, 280, 310, 360 slaves 
respectively, and for three voyages with 100 slaves and one voyage with 900, the 
average is the same: 300 slaves. The standard deviation is the clue to how much 
the average resembles particular cases in the group for which it is calculated. 
Divide the standard deviation by the average. The smaller the quotient, the 
closer particular cases are to the average. The larger the quotient, the more 
variation there is above and below the average.</p>');

the researcher’s attention patterns that might not be observed simply scanning 
the statistics contained in a table. Tables also present the danger of tempting 
the researcher to exaggerate the importance of small differences. If differences

FAQs about how to construct the three kinds of graphs. Each begins with a simple 
definition of the graph type. In general, bar charts are appropriate for 
comparing two to ten categories that can be measured numerically; pie charts are 
appropriate for comparing percentages of a whole; and XY charts show the 
relationship, or correlation, between two numerical variables.</p>');

INSERT INTO faqs (id, cat_id, question, answer) VALUES (33, 7, 'Is there a 
technique for making effective graphs?', '<p>Remember that a limited number of 
categories of comparison is necessary for both bar and pie charts. Too many 
categories make a chart difficult to interpret. If you find this to be the case, 
use the left query frame to limit the number of categories or values to a 
manageable number. A bar chart is useful for comparing several categories on a 
numerical scale, for example, the number of voyages on British and Dutch vessels 
in the period 1641-1700, when development of sugar colonies in the Caribbean 
began, or number of slaves embarked in different regions of Africa, or the 
average size (in tons) of United States and British ships. Number of voyages, 
slaves embarked, and tonnage are all numerical variables. Flag or nationality 
and region are categorical variables.  Use of the query frame to limit 
categories represented in a bar or pie chart is a key to making effective use of 
the feature.</p>');

might be correlated can be plotted against each other on this type of chart, for 
example, Middle passage (days) and (Avg)Percentage of slaves embarked who died 
on voyage. Remember, too, that the query frame on the left can be used to 
further refine conditions for observing the correlation between two numeric 
variables.</p>');

Database and Estimates both have timelines. How do I use them to observe 
differences over time? Should trends look the same in both sections?', '<p>The 
timeline is a bar graph that functions similarly in Estimates and the Voyages 
Database. The main difference is that it shows only captives embarked and 
disembarked per year in Estimates, while it can describe annual change of a 
larger number of variables in the Voyages Database. For the latter, click on a 
variable in the selection box and then on the button "Show." The timeline for 
Estimates includes a chronology which illustrate how this graphic can be used to 
show the impact of critical events on the slave trade. Moving the cursor from 
left to right in the main graph area causes a bar to appear indicating year, and 
information for that year appears below the timeline. To view a segment of time 
in more detail, click and drag bars on the left and right of the smaller chart 
area below the main chart area to the beginning and end year of the desired

lacking, the number of embarked and disembarked slaves will be greater in its 
timeline than in the one for the main database, but trends will be similar.

differences. The Voyages Database permits users to put dots on maps 
corresponding to three levels of detail in labeling: broad regions, regions, and 
places or ports. In Estimates, only dots for broad and specific regions appear 
on maps. Embarkation regions in Africa are the same in the two sections, but 
broad disembarkation regions are slightly different. In the Voyages Database, 
there are six: Europe, Africa, Brazil, the Caribbean, Spanish Central America, 
and Mainland North America. In Estimates, the Caribbean is further distinguished 
by the major powers holding slave colonies there: Great Britain, France, the 
Netherlands, and Denmark. Colonies in the Guianas are included in the Caribbean. 
Spanish Americas combines Spain’s Caribbean colonies (Santo Domingo, Cuba, and 
Puerto Rico) with its mainland colonies, in Central America and in the Rio de la 
Plata basin. Specific regions within Mainland North America, the British, 
French, and Danish Caribbean, and the Dutch and Spanish Americas, are also

of departure the default map for the entire slave trade from 1514 to 1866. There 
is only one yellow dot. It is placed over Africa, the continent from which all 
slaves were taken. The relative sizes of the red dots show that the Caribbean, 
Brazil, Mainland North America and Spanish Central America, Africa and Europe 
were recipients of slaves, in that order of importance. The legend shows 
approximately how many disembarked in each broad region. Rolling over the dots 
gives exact statistics. Now change the time frame on the left to the period from 
1808 to 1866, the era of abolition of the slave trade. You will notice that the

smaller areas of the Atlantic and are suitable for maps with labels of specific 
regions, but not ports within them. Scale 1 covers the smallest area and shows 
the most detail. It is meant to be used for viewing maps showing the exact
