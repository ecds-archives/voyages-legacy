		<p>One of the goals of the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Online
		Database has been to bring the work of historians to a K-12 audience
		and allow students to engage in the process of historical inquiry. A
		variety of lesson plans spanning a range of grade levels have been
		developed to offer teachers diverse approaches from which to teach
		students about the largest forced migration in history. The lesson
		plans are tied to national standards in Social Studies (National
		Council for the Social Studies), History (National Center for History
		in the Schools), and Geography (National Council Geography Education),
		and when applicable Economics (National Council on Economic Education)
		and State standards.</p>

		<h2><a href="#">Lesson Plan</a></h2>

		<p>Here you will find a variety standards-based lesson plans for
		use in your classroom.</p>

		<h2><a href="#">Links</a></h2>

		<p>Here you will find maps for teaching and testing geographical
		understanding of the slave trade. [This may be a feature we add to
		later versions of the database. We are including it here as a
		placeholder and to see what suggestions test users have for adding
		additional K-12 tools and resources.]</p>
