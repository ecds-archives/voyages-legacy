		<p>The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database in the first section of the 
		website contains all slaving expeditions documented up until now.  
		“Assessing the Slave Trade,” the second section of the website, presents 
		three ways historians and researchers use information from the database 
		to interpret the slave trade: essays, quantitative analysis, and maps.  
		In the second, “Estimates” of the full volume of the slave trade by year, 
		national carrier, and routes of slaving expeditions, interactive features 
		enable users to raise their own questions about the data and obtain answers 
		in the form of tables, a timeline, or maps. </p>

		<h2><a href="essays-intro-01.faces">Essays</a></h2>

		<p>This sub-section contains interpretations in traditional text format.  
		An introductory essay provides a broad interpretation and overview of the 
		volume and structure of the trans-Atlantic slave trade from inception to 
		suppression.  Several vignettes describe the personal experience of Africans 
		carried to the Americas on slave ships.  Finally, research notes focus on 
		more specialized topics.  Other “Essays” will be added as the website develops.  
		Its <a href="../about/contact.faces">editorial board</a> will consider for publication in the 
		“Essays” section any text that uses databases on the website as a major source.</p>

		<h2><a href="estimates.faces">Estimates</a></h2>

		<p>Although the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database includes all slave 
		voyages that have been documented up to now, it cannot claim to be complete. 
		Records of many voyages have disappeared, in some cases irretrievably, 
		while other documents remain to be discovered in public and private archives. 
		The “Estimates,” on the other hand, provide an educated guess of how large 
		the slave trade actually was.  Altogether, the estimates are about 25 percent 
		higher than unadjusted numbers in the main database. They raise the final 
		totals to over 12,500,000 Africans forced to undertake the Middle Passage 
		and around 10,700,000 who completed it, the largest forced migration in modern history.</p>
		
		<h2><a href="intromaps.faces">Introductory Maps</a></h2>
		
		<p>A third way of using the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database to interpret 
		the slave trade is to represent statistics derived from it on historical maps.  
		A project is now underway to create an <font style="font-style: italic;">Atlas</font> of 
		the Slave Trade showing cartographically patterns and trends documented in the database.  Yale 
		University Press, the publisher of the atlas, and Mapping Specialists, Ltd., 
		have given the Voyages website permission to preview 9 of over 200 maps that 
		will make up the <font style="font-style: italic;">Atlas</font>. They depict the origins of the Atlantic slave trade, 
		its development over time, how wind and ocean currents shaped its routes, and 
		how it affected regions and ports in Africa and the Americas.</p>
